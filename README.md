# aoc

Solutions for Advent of Code.

## Installation

Use `pip`'s local install feature once you have pulled down the files:

```shell
pip install .
```

## Usage

Once installed, use the following command structure to process answers for that year/date:

```shell
python -m aoc.y2024.d01  # runs the first day of 2024
```

## TODO

- [ ] Extend instructions to cover test data
- [ ] Improve UX (update `runner` with more safe guards, useful messaging, etc.)
